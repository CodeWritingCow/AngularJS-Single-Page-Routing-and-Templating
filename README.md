# AngularJS: Single Page Routing and Templating
_by Gary Pang, "CodeWritingCow"_

I am building a simple single-page app with AngularJS. From the Scotch.io tutorial, ["Single Page Apps with AngularJS Routing and Templating,"](https://scotch.io/tutorials/single-page-apps-with-angularjs-routing-and-templating) by Chris Sevilleja.

## Removing hashtags from URLs
I remove the default "#"s from the AngularJS URLs by following another tutorial, ["Pretty URLs in AngularJS: Removing the #,"](https://scotch.io/quick-tips/pretty-urls-in-angularjs-removing-the-hashtag) also by Sevilleja.
